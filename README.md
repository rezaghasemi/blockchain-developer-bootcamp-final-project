# My final project in blockchain-developer-bootcamp


An election is undoubtedly an indispensable part of our life because it is a formal group decision-making process. Although it is the ideal way to get the majority's opinion, it is not possible to have an election for every single decision since it imposes a high cost. Smart contracts can address this problem by offering an efficient way to hold an election. People can easily vote for their candidates with only some clicks.

In this project, "**Weighted Election**" (WE) will be implemented which is an improvement on regular elections. In WE those who have more Ether in their account have more votes. Interesting! :D. There are many situations that we want to favor some voters (here account with higher balance) to the others. Take a company as a salient example. stockholders who have more shares should be able to have more influence on the company futures policy and this can be obtained by a secure and efficient WE.

**WE consists of the following steps:**

1. Candidates will be registered.
2. People register in the election before the election commences.
3. A snapshot of registered accounts' balances will be taken.
4. Account will have limited time to vote.
5. Regarding the votes and the weights and votes, the winner will be identified.

**What we are going to do (ToDo list):** 
1. Consult with mentors about the project.
2. Make a list of required functions. 
3. Start Coding.
4. Debug with the help of mentors.
5. Submit the project.
